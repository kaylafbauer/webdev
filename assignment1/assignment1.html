      <p> As someone who has never joined Facebook as an act of resistance against it, I resonated a lot with this article. When Facebook was in its "cool era," I was too young to be able to use it, and then Instagram came around and that's what everyone my age was using instead. Facebook was just something we used to connect with family, so it was always something associated with older people. Wagner writes, "The Twitter accounts “Cursed Boomer Images” and “Absurd Conservamemes” post fresh outpourings from the depths of poorly designed, politically noxious, brainworm-ridden Facebook depravity." These "brainworm-ridden" posts are the only things I have been able to associate with Facebook for a long time. </p>
      <p>The internet used to be a place I went when I was younger to play fun dress-up games and cool math games. Now, it's something that is associated with a lot of negativity and overstimulation. You aren't able to discover anything new on the internet on your phone because you're too busy being bombarded by a million different messages on all of your apps, so it becomes very overwhelming. Wagner writes about Facebook, "..it is roundly vilified for the role it played in the election of far-right idiots and parties to positions of power, its misuse of users’ data through companies like Cambridge Analytica, its generally hapless promotion of fake news and hate speech, its whimsical annihilation of journalism—all for a quick thirty-nine billion or so in ad revenue." Unlike the demise of Myspace, Facebook seems like something that will never go away. They've grown much larger than just their original social networking website. The amount of misinformation available on the internet with the lack of any kind of government regulation about it makes me nervous for where we are headed in the future.</p>
      <p> Wagner writes, "Nostalgia, I’m reminded, is profitable—it remains one of the easiest to execute and cheapest grifts of neoliberal culture." Everything on the internet now seems to be so nostalgia based because I think it's hard for everyone to imagine a better future when the world around us is so perilous. Everyone is seeking the comfort of the internet from when they were younger in order to distract themselves from everything else going on around them in the world. Customization is becoming a bigger trend this year, so it makes sense that people are growing tired of platforms where the layout of their profile is picked for them. As Wagner says, "It’s true that Facebook controls your data; meanwhile, you control not a single element of Facebook." People want to be able to show off what makes them unique, and rigid profile controls don't allow the user to do that.</p>
